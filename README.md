### Summary
62% (69) of the incidents were observed during the weekend.  Considering the time of year the data was collected and
that the majority of sighting being observed over the weekend, it is likely that any coorelation between the number of sighting may have more to do with more people are outside during the weekends and where the weather is warmer.
43% (48) of the incidents were observed in four of the largest states by population - California, Florida, Texas, and New York.
A significant increase in data would be needed to provide more accurate and detailed analysis.
